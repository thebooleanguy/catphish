# If needed, add a tab switcher here (XPath if tabs are detected)

# Upload via URL (workaround to get a URL for local file: use file:///path)
# Google does not support local file upload via URL input
# So we need to serve it or use another method. Better to automate file upload.

# Alternative: simulate file upload (bypassing URL input)
# Instead of image URL input, upload the image
# Google doesn't allow URL uploads for local files, so let's do this:
# 1. Click "Upload an image" tab
# 2. Upload the file via <input type="file">

# Locate file input (hidden input field)
upload_input = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//input[@type='file']")

# Done! Keep browser open
# driver.quit()  # Uncomment if you want to auto-close
